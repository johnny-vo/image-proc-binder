[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/johnny-vo/image-proc-binder/HEAD)



This jupyter-notebook will be based on the lecture image processing M70. Python will be used to teach basic techniques and algorithms for image processing. Students will get an insight into the world of python. Upon this they will use it to process images.
In the following course the students should be able to calculate and evaluate certain parameters of images. They should learn to implement different methods for image processing in the spatial and frequency space. 
This includes e.g. methods for denoising, edge detection and compression.
